I am a computer sciences student at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and I am eager to apply my skills to working on projects in internships. 

During the summer after my freshman year, I've completed an internship through Breakthrough Tech at Google to learn about the user research and product design process. I was delighted to apply my creativity into brainstorming ideas and creating prototypes to illustrate how to utilize existing software to enhance current products.

Currently, I'm also serving as a TA for a CS course at UIC. I am passionate about helping other students learn and succeed. In this role, I am challenged to utilize my problem-solving skills to help my students with variety of coding problems and practice my communication skills.

Through my studies, I have gained experience with developing and testing applications and programs. I am familiar with several coding languages including Java, C/C++, and python. I am interested in app development and software engineering.
